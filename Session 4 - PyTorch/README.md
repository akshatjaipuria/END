# Session 4 - PyTorch
Use this as a [reference ](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-sentiment-analysis/blob/master/2 - Upgraded Sentiment Analysis.ipynb). 

Change this code in such a way that:

1. it has 3 LSTM layers
2. it has used a **for loop** to do so in the **forward** function
3. the dropout value used is 0.2
4. trained on the text that is reversed (for example "my name is John Wick" becomes "Wick John is name my"
5. achieves 87% or more accuracy
